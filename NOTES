Things to note and explain in the Report

1. Different Tenses are considered as different propositions and thus we have not 
reduced them to simpler form.
i.e
John was a good guy
John  is a good guy
These are two different proposition and take different variables in our knowledge dataset

2. It is not clear if the premises in the argument are all conjunctions or disjunctions before being implied by the proposition
i.e for the following set of premise
    a
    b
    c
and the conclusion 
    d
It is not clear if this will be interpreted as
    (a ^ b ^ c) => d
or
    (a v b v c) => d
Right now, we are using the first option (conjuction) and wikipedia is not clear.
