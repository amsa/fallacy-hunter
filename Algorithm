1. Take the sentence
2. Set the boundaries so that seperate knowledge can be extracted
    2.1 Replace the following explicit logic operators -
        AND
            "but" with keyword "and"
            "." with keyword "and"
        IMPLICATION
            "therefore" with "=>"
            "so" with "=>"
3. Stem the Sentence as a whole (just normal stemming and not chunking)
    (Stemming seperates the sentences with "." as different array elements
    so that we get different knowledge set for separate variable)
4. Tag the sentence (stemming before so that we get the same tags for the same verb but represented in different format)
5.
