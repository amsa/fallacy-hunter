1. Take the sentence
2. Set the boundaries so that seperate knowledge can be extracted
    2.1 Replace the following explicit logic operators -
        AND
            "but" with keyword "and"
            "." with keyword "and"
        IMPLICATION
            "therefore" with "=>"
            "so" with "=>"
3. Stem the Sentence as a whole (just normal stemming and not chunking)
    (Stemming seperates the sentences with "." as different array elements
    so that we get different knowledge set for separate variable)
4. Tag the sentence (stemming before so that we get the same tags for the same verb but represented in different format)
5. Extract the Premise and the conclusion part.
6. Make the Premise and the conclusion part, separately into well formed expression 
    6.1 Find, NOT in the proposition, extract and apply it to the proposition as unary operator
    6.2 Recursively apply the AND (Conj) to the list of propositions variables
